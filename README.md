# C-language-Project
Welcome to my C language repository! Here, you'll find two exciting projects in one place.

Number Guessing Game: Test your intuition and luck in this classic game. You have to guess a randomly generated number within a specific range. The game provides hints to help you narrow down your choices until you hit the correct number. Enjoy challenging yourself and see how many attempts it takes to be the ultimate guesser!

Rock Paper Scissors Game: Experience the thrill of this iconic hand game. Play against the computer and choose between rock, paper, or scissors. The program determines the winner based on the classic rules: rock crushes scissors, paper covers rock, and scissors cut paper. Sharpen your strategies and have endless fun!

Both projects are implemented in C language, designed to be user-friendly with clear instructions and console-based interactions. Beginners can easily understand the code and learn from it. Enhance your programming skills, explore the source code, and feel free to contribute to making these games even more enjoyable. Happy gaming and coding!
